Just repo for my projects where I took interesting challenges and try to implement it

Each challenge has it's own readme in folder with challenge's source and installation guide

Here's list of all challenges. Each challenge has it's own branch until it'll be
ready and then merged into master:

* [ ] sand simulation
* [ ] world generation
